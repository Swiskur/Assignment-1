#a

win = GraphWin()

#a produces a point on the graphics window which represents the point in the code. It is a small pixel dot just to the right and below the middle of the graphics window


#b
c = Circle(Point(30,40), 25)
c.setFill("blue")
c.setOutline("red")

#b produces a large circle in the top left corner that is filled in with blue and outlined in red. The point is larger because of the 25 given to the circle to give it a circumference.


#c
r = Rectangle(Point(20,20), Point(40,40))
r.setFill(color_rgb(0,255,150))
r.setWidth(3)

#c produces a green rectangle that is larger than th point in a and smaller than the circle in b in the top left corner of the graphics window

#d

l = Line(Point(100,100), Point(100,200))

#d produces a red arrow that comes from the bottom of the page and extends to the middle while pointing up


#e

#e produces a large oval in the upper left corner of the graphics window. The oval is not filled in and has no outline or color.

#f
Shape= Polygon(Point(5,5), Point(10,10), Point(5,10), Point(10,5))

#f created a small polygon that somewhat looks like an X with the insides filled with orange in the top right corner.
